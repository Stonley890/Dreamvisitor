# The multiplier of the distance weight when choosing mail delivery locations.
# Takes the ratio (between 0 and 1) of the distance to the maximum distance between locations,
#   multiplies it by this value, and adds it to the mail location weight.
# This weight is used to randomly choose a mail location to deliver to provide a realistic
#   relationship between delivery locations.
# At 0, distance has no effect on location selection.
# At 1, the weight will have a slight effect on the location selection.
# At 10, the weight will have a significant effect on the location selection.
# The weight is applied inversely, making closer distances worth more than further distances.
